1.  What is SQL? What is DML? What is DDL? Recite the most important SQL commands.

What is SQL

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used to communicate with a database. It is standard language for relational database management systems developed by Microsoft. SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update data on a database, or retrieve data from a database. Some common relational database management systems that use SQL are: Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft SQL Server, Access.

DML

A data manipulation language (DML) is a family of syntax elements similar to a computer programming language used for selecting, inserting, deleting and updating data in a database. Performing read-only queries of data is sometimes also considered a component of DML.

Data manipulation language comprises the SQL data change statements, which modify stored data but not the schema or database objects. Manipulation of persistent database objects, tables or stored procedures, via the SQL schema statements, rather than the data stored within them, is considered to be part of a separate data definition language.

DDL

A data definition language or data description language (DDL) is a syntax similar to a computer programming language for defining data structures, especially database schemas.Main functionalities DDL gives are creating, altering, dropping, granting, revoking.

SQL commands

SELECT - get data from a database table

UPDATE - change data in a database table

DELETE - remove data from a database table

INSERT INTO - insert new data in a database table

CREATE TABLE - creates a new database table

ALTER TABLE - alters a database table

DROP TABLE - deletes a database table

1.  What is Transact-SQL (T-SQL)?

T-SQL (Transact-SQL) is a set of programming extensions from Sybase and Microsoft that add several features to the Structured Query Language (SQL) including transaction control, exception and error handling, row processing, and declared variables. Microsoft's SQL Server and Sybase's SQL server support T-SQL statements.
